# File Encryptor & Decryptor

A command-line tool built with Python to securely encrypt and decrypt files using symmetric-key encryption.

## How It Works

This script uses the `cryptography` library to perform encryption and decryption.

1.  **Key Management**: A unique secret key is generated and stored in a `secret.key` file. This key is used for both encrypting and decrypting data. If the key file doesn't exist, it's created automatically.
2.  **Encryption**: When you choose to encrypt a file, the script reads its content, encrypts it using the secret key, and saves the encrypted data into a new file with a `.encrypted` extension.
3.  **Decryption**: To decrypt a file, the script reads the encrypted content, uses the same secret key to decrypt it, and saves the original content into a new file with a `.decrypted.txt` extension.

## Features

-   **Symmetric Encryption**: Uses the Fernet symmetric encryption algorithm for strong security.
-   **Automatic Key Generation**: Creates a `secret.key` file if one is not found.
-   **User-Friendly Menu**: An interactive command-line interface to easily choose between encrypting, decrypting, or exiting.
-   **Error Handling**: Provides feedback for common errors like file not found or decryption failures.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

-   Python 3
-   `cryptography` library

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/your-repository-name.git](https://github.com/your-username/your-repository-name.git)
    cd your-repository-name
    ```
2.  **Install the required library:**
    ```bash
    pip install cryptography
    ```

## File Structure

-   `main.py`: The core Python script with all the logic.
-   `secret.key`: **(Auto-generated)** Stores the secret encryption key. **Do not share this file!**
-   `*.encrypted`: Encrypted files generated by the script.
-   `*.decrypted.txt`: Decrypted files generated by the script.

## ⚠️ Security Note

The security of your encrypted files depends entirely on the `secret.key` file.
-   **Keep your `secret.key` file safe and private.** Anyone with access to this key can decrypt your files.
-   If you lose the key, you will **not** be able to decrypt your files.
-   It is recommended to add `secret.key` to your `.gitignore` file to avoid accidentally committing it to a public repository.
